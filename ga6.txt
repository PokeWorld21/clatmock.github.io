motion
scaler quantity 
no direction
mass speed

vector quantity
direction
force spped

distance 
total path coverd  in certain time
its unit is metre
shortedt distance is displacement
displacement is equal or shorter than distance

speed 
distance upon time

velocity
displacemnt upon time

accleration
change in velocity upon time
rate of change of velocity of object

gravity m/s 2

circular motion
centrpedal force 
cntre seeking force

centrifuegal force 
outward force 

newtons law of motion

1st law of motion
body is at rest unless external force is applied

2nd law of motion
force applied on body is equaly to object in which force is applied

3rd law of motion
every action has equal and opposite reaction

work 
body gets displaced work is done
w = f.s
unit is joule

energy
capacity of doing work
joule 

kinetic energy 
energy due to motion

potenial energy
energy possed by object virtue of its position
pe = mgh

power
rate of doing work
work upon tome

gravitation
force of attraction coming from earth 

gravity
value 9.8 m/s2

escape velocity
needed to beat earths harvity field
earths surface 11.2 km/s
moon surface 2.38 km/s

keplers lwar
all planet move around sun in ellipicataloribits
sun is constannt

pressure
si unit pascal
formila f/a

law of floatation
depends upon density
density of object is less than density of water
principle of floatation by archimedes

buoyancy
upward force exerted by a fluid on a immerseed body

archimedes principle
when solid body is immeresed partialy pr whole there is same apparent loss in wieght

wave
transport of energy 

mechincal waves
requires material to transport energy

electromagnetic waves
do not require any medium like wifi 

dopplers effect
sound is heard by observer differnt frequency or time 

heat
form of enrgy which oroduces sensation warmth

transmission of heat
conduction
heat is transferred without any medium

convection
liquid to gas heat

radiation
quickest way of transmission

light
speed 3x108 m/s

refraction
whrn ray of light bend towards normal


scientic instruments
ammeter - electric current
anemometer - velocity of wind
barometer - atmospheric pressure
calorimeter - quantities of heat
endoscope - internal parts of body
galvanometer - electric current
hydrometer - relative density of liquids
hygrometer - measures level of humidity
lactometer - density of milk
machmeter - speed of aircraft
tonometer - pitch of sound
